# Single-cell CITE-seq integration in Python

CITE-seq is a method for cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing. CITE-seq datasets comprise transcriptome-wide measurements for single cells (gene expression) as well as surface protein level information, typically for a few dozens of proteins. The method is described in [Stoeckius et al., 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4380) and also [on the cite-seq.com website](https://cite-seq.com/).

These notebooks cover different CITE-seq datasets:

- peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) ([data by 10x Genomics can be found here](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets/3.0.2/5k_pbmc_protein_v3)).
