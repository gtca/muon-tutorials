Trimodal single-cell omics
==========================

A few different technologies have been demonstrated that enable high-throughput profiling of three modalities.

For instance, `TEA-seq <https://elifesciences.org/articles/63632>`_ and `DOGMA-seq <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-021-00927-2>`_ enable gene expression, chromatin accessibility and surface protein profiling. `NEAT-seq <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-022-01461-y>`_ profiles nuclear proteins in addition to RNA and ATAC modalities.

The notebooks below demonstrate how to load and process some of these datasets:
