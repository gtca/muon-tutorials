# Tutorials for multimodal omics data analysis

This repository contains examples showcasing processing and interpretation of multimodal omics data using [muon](https://github.com/scverse/muon).

## Single-cell ATAC and gene expression

- [These tutorials on 10k PBMC cells](single-cell-rna-atac/pbmc10k) demonstrate how to work with chromatin accessibility and gene expression data from individual cells.

## CITE-seq

- [This tutorial on 5k PBMC cells](cite-seq/1-CITE-seq-PBMC-5k.ipynb) describes how to process CITE-seq data (including antibody-derived tags counts normalisation) and how to integrate surface protein abundance and gene expression.

## Spatiotemporal omics

- [These tutorials](mefisto/) show how smooth factors can be learnt, across time and space, with models such as [MEFISTO](https://biofam.github.io/MOFA2/MEFISTO).

## Biomedical applications

- [Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) notebook](CLL.ipynb) gives a glimpse of the utility of multi-omics data integration in biomedical applications.
