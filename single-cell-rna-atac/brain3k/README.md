# Single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq integration

Information on joint gene expression and open chromatin profiling [can be found here](https://www.10xgenomics.com/products/single-cell-multiome-atac-plus-gene-expression/).

Data processing and analysis workflow is split into multiple chapters.

1. [Processing and Integration](1-Processing-and-Integration.ipynb). This notebook largely follows [PBMC tutorials](../pbmc10k/).

2. [Celltype Annotation](2-Celltype-Annotation.ipynb). This notebook offers a closer look at different approaches to annotate cell types.
