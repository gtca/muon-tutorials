# Single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq integration in Python

Data processing and analysis workflow is split into multiple chapters.

1. [Gene Expression Processing](1-Gene-Expression-Processing.ipynb). This notebook largely follows [this scanpy tutorial](https://scanpy-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pbmc3k.html) on processing and clustering PBMCs. 

1. [Peaks Processing](2-Chromatin-Accessibility-Processing.ipynb). While following the flow of the previous chapter, it introduces ATAC-related functionality for data processing and visualisation.

1. [Multimodal Omics Data Integration](3-Multimodal-Omics-Data-Integration.ipynb). This notebook demonstrates how multiple modalities can be combined in a single Python workflow and how multiomics methods such as [multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA)](https://github.com/bioFAM/MOFA2) can be applied for data analysis and interpretation.
