# MEFISTO models with muon

MEFISTO is a method for the functional integration of spatial and temporal omics data. More information can be found [on the method's website](https://biofam.github.io/MOFA2/MEFISTO). 

These tutorials adapt [the original MEFISTO tutorials](https://github.com/bioFAM/MEFISTO_tutorials) to use `muon` for training:
